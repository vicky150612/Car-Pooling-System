# Carpooling Manager

## Overview

The Carpooling Manager is a system designed to optimize carpooling by assigning the same car and driver to users traveling along similar routes (as determined by the map). It ensures fair fare calculation, proportionate to the distance traveled by each user.

3. Workflow Overview:
